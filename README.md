# Online-Movie-Ticket-Booking-System
Users can login into the system and he can book tickets for a particular movie and tickets will be send to user's email.

This entire system was built on spring boot framework.

Spring security has been added to the system including login and logout authentication.

CrudRepository has been used for database handling.

HTML, CSS , JS ,BOOTSTRAP have been used to get the best UI for the system.

Ajax calls also have been used.

This ticketing system solved some testcases,

like 

1->if current_date is less than release date of the movie then 'No shows available' will be displayed.

2->for every movie in a particular theatre there will be end date. So based on movie response end date can be changed.

3->User can also rate the movie.
